They follow you beyond the gates of Highcastle to the infernal battlegrounds on the other side of the river, where you clash with the foreign invaders. The trained killers by your side remain loyal and coldhearted, moving from one violent skirmish to the next.\n\nThe western district keeps burning. The war goes on with no end in sight. The streets are crowded by rooks and ravens. The birds are pecking at the scorched flesh of dead bodies. They flew in from all over the highlands, attracted by the pillars of black smoke. This is hell, but it feels like home.\n\nEach moment of rest is a blessing. There is no time to think about the past or the future. You are only concerned about two things: the death of your enemies and the survival of your comrades. Nothing else. Thoughts drown in rivers of blood.\n\nYou master the art of war, moving under cover of darkness and lying in ambush. You strike fear into the hearts of the foreign invaders. You earn the respect of noble knights and common soldiers. They call you the Dark Brigade.\n\nMany of your comrades are dead when the war is over. The last foreign ships vanish on the horizon, leaving you with scars and memories.\n\nPeace returns to the highlands. You played a crucial part in the war effort, but there’s no place for outlaws in the annals of history. The Dark Brigade has served its purpose. It’s time to move on.\n\nYou roam the wilderness, living off the land. The question keeps you up at night. Where do we go from here?",
  "ENDING-5e6fceb4985b8700008f4ffc-NARRATIVE": "## THE COMRADE\n\nYou wake up in the forest at night, feeling the wind against your face. Someone is carrying you on their shoulders. It’s Avon Lorca. The former gladiator says: “It’s over.”\n\nThis place must be far away from the city, somewhere deep in the wilderness. Your many wounds are wrapped in bandages, but the pain is still there. It doesn’t take long before you go back to sleep.\n\nThe sun rises over the ruins of a burned village. You feel better now. Avon Lorca brought you here in search of refuge, but every place is the same. The war has destroyed the western highlands.\n\nYou keep moving. There are many dangers on the road, but Avon Lorca is watching your back. He becomes a close friend, often talking about his glory days. The former gladiator tells you about his mansion in the south, not far from the town of Sickle. All the money he made from fighting was stashed away in several hiding places down there.\n\nIt’s a long journey, but there’s nowhere else to go. The mansion is your best bet. Might as well give it a shot.",

The enemy is dead. The Sleep Temple is like a tomb where the past is buried. The sun is shining. The future lies ahead.\n\nThe sandstone path takes you back to Soma Gardens, where you wander aimlessly in the quiet orchards. It’s a good feeling, having nowhere to go. There’s a sense of detachment. It’s freedom. No one tells you what to do. Not anymore.\n\nThe nobles live in fear, thinking about the war. They have so much to lose. The foreign army could breach the gates of Highcastle any minute now, destroying their precious way of life, burning the city to ash.\n\nYou know it’s true, but it makes no difference. The knights are the last line of defense. Let them fight their own battles. The war will end with or without you. Those are the thoughts on your mind as you walk over Selikro Plaza to the Stray Wolf Inn.\n\nThe place is almost empty. The drinks keep coming. It doesn’t take long before you loosen up, telling them everything. The stories are brutal and strange. The maid and her father don’t know what to believe, but they feel your pain.\n\nThe innkeeper offers you to stay here until the war is over. You take him up on it, knowing that commoners like you aren’t supposed to dwell in the Noble Heights. It’s a quiet life behind the walls, just counting down the days.\n\nPeace. The word spreads like wildfire, but there’s no time to celebrate. The knights have returned and now they come knocking at your door. It’s time to go. The gates are open. It’s time to cross the bridge to the world outside.",
  "ENDING-5e6fcf90985b8700008f4ffe-NARRATIVE": "## THE MASTER\n\nYou retire to the master bedroom, where you get some well-deserved rest. No one disturbs your slumber. They wouldn’t dare.\n\nYour nightmares are haunted by the spirits of the dead. So many have died by your hand, for no good reason. They all burn in the fire below, never to be seen again. Memories of the past are buried in dreams of money and power. You sleep like a child. Your heart is now cold.\n\nSunrise. You inspect the marble floor in the atrium, seeing your own reflection. The slaves are eager to please. They removed all traces of the old master.\n\nIt’s the birth of a new regime. You call a meeting and lay out the plans for the future. They listen close, understanding what must be done.\n\nYou are the crime lord of Noble Heights, trapped behind the walls until the war is over. It’s a brand new day when they open the gates. The crew is primed and ready to go. Time to make some real money.",

They put something in your blood. It will make you obey.\n\nThe first job is simple. Murder the priest. The old man talks too much. You catch him by surprise in the church, slashing his throat. He dies without knowing what hit him.\n\nNo one saw what happened. You feel nothing at all, returning to the Sleep Temple at night. They offer you some opium for peace of mind, but there’s no need for that.\n\nThe war ends. They open the gates. You are summoned to the atrium, where Mantis waits with a devilish grin. It’s time to get out there and put in some real work.",

You dream of the stingray. The creature invades your mind, corrupting your thoughts and memories beyond repair. It goes on for what feels like eternity.\n\nYour eyes flicker, catching a glimpse of the world outside. He’s taking you to the torture chamber. Your body is moving, but your mind is gone, swept away by a dark influence.\n\nThe affliction of the mind. It breaks you down to pieces. Your soul remains dormant in a battered husk. There’s nothing but pain and suffering, beyond anything you ever imagined.\n\nYou awaken like a beast of burden, having no other desire but to serve your lord and master.\n\nThe prison cell is dark. There’s no need for chains, but you wear them like a badge of honor.\n\nYou are sold off to the highest bidder when the war is over.",
  "ENDING-5e6fd019985b8700008f5001-NARRATIVE": "## THE AVENGER\n\nThey attack without hesitation. The killers are closing in from all sides. The atrium becomes a stage for unrelenting carnage, where heads are split in half and bones crack like dry branches.\n\nFueled by the rush of adrenaline, you enter a frame of mind where dream and reality is one and the same. There’s nothing in this world but violence and vengeful hatred. You have returned to the killing fields.\n\nIntoxicated by rage, you remember everything they did to make you suffer, everything they took from you, making them pay back a thousandfold. You are determined to keep going until no one in this room is left breathing.\n\nIt gets to a point where you realize that everyone is dead. You’re all alone, surrounded by piles of gore and bone fragments. The bodies are mutilated beyond recognition. The pale king will be pleased, for you have done his bidding.\n\nYou walk out from the Sleep Temple, covered in blood from head to toe. The nobles give you strange looks when you roam the quiet orchards of Soma Gardens. Feeling dazed and numb, you pay them no mind.\n\nYou pass out from exhaustion somewhere in the Noble Heights. The knights lock you away in the dungeon, where you stay until the war is over. They have no idea who you are, where you came from or what to do with you.\n\nAs luck would have it, someone is looking out for you. It’s the knight from the bridge, who tasked you with sending a message to the Lord of Highcastle. He shows up one day and decides to set you free.\n\nThe gates are open. The world outside is waiting.
